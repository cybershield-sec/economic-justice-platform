"Minimalist abstract background representing economic equality and community solidarity. Use geometric shapes forming interconnected circles and lines, soft gradient background with warm earth tones (ocher, terracotta, deep blue). Subtle patterns suggesting growth and connection. Professional, inspiring, and accessible."

PROMPT 2 (Story Platform):
