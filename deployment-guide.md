  "style-src": "'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
  "img-src": "'self' data: https:",
  "connect-src": "'self' https://api.openai.com https://api.anthropic.com"
};
```

### File Upload Security (Future)
- Implement file type validation
- Add file size limits
- Use secure upload services (Cloudinary, AWS S3)
- Content scanning for inappropriate material

## 🚀 URGENT: Global Deployment Strategy

### **CRITICAL TIMELINE: Deploy Everywhere Immediately**

**Why Speed Matters:**
- Revolutionary ideas have a **narrow window** before they're contained
- Economic systems actively resist disruption - delay = death
- The parable resonates **NOW** because people feel the oppression daily
- Each day of delay allows the "Kings" to adapt and counter-message

### **Phase 1: Immediate Global Launch (Week 1)**

**Deploy to ALL major platforms simultaneously:**

```bash
# Mirror deployment across maximum channels
git clone [repository]
cd economic-justice-platform

# Deploy to ALL static hosts simultaneously
vercel --prod --scope global
netlify deploy --prod --site economic-justice-global
surge . economic-justice.surge.sh
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Mirror on decentralized platforms
ipfs add -r . # IPFS for censorship resistance
arweave deploy . # Permanent web storage
```

**Platform Multiplication:**
- **GitHub Pages**: `tally-stick.github.io`
- **Netlify**: `tally-stick.netlify.app`
- **Vercel**: `tally-stick.vercel.app`
- **Surge**: `tally-stick.surge.sh`
- **Firebase**: `tally-stick.web.app`
- **IPFS**: Decentralized, uncensorable
- **Arweave**: Permanent, immutable storage

### **Phase 1.5: Viral Seeding (Week 1-2)**

**Crisis Response Protocol:**
- If platform goes down → activate backup URLs
- If social media bans → migrate to alternative platforms  
- If legal threats → engage network of activist lawyers
- If co-optation attempts → release "official" versions only

## 🔥 **REMEMBER: Ideas Are Only As Powerful As Their Spread**

The King's Reckoning isn't just a story - it's a **cognitive virus** that changes how people see economic systems. But viruses need hosts, and hosts need exposure.

**Every day we delay:**
- More families lose homes to medical debt
- More workers accept poverty wages  
- More communities get displaced by gentrification
- More power concentrates in fewer hands

**Every day we deploy:**
- More people understand their oppression isn't individual failure
- More communities discover alternatives exist
- More organizers get tools for building power
- More cracks appear in unjust systems

The platform is ready. The moment is now. **Deploy everywhere, immediately.**

Time to change the world. 🌍⚡
